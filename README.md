This repository demonstrates a common R error related to subsetting data frames.  The `bug.r` file contains code that attempts to select columns from a data frame using a character vector that includes non-existent column names.  This leads to an "undefined columns selected" error. The `bugSolution.r` file provides a robust solution using `dplyr` to handle the issue gracefully. The solution avoids the error and explains how to safely subset even when column names are uncertain.
